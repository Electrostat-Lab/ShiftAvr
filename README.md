A modern implementation of avr-core and GNU libraries for avr microcontroller uints purely written in C.

## This project is composed of several subprojects: 
- [x] shiftavr-core: A low-level API that provides a direct implementation to the internal avr-units.
- [ ] shiftavr-api: A high-level API that provides a combination of several hardware and sensors implementation combined with high-level design patterns and software principles to engage the core into a competitive level.
- [ ] shiftavr-examples: Tech-demos and examples for the shiftavr project.

#### The project `shiftavr-core` includes the following libraries: 
- [x] libuart
- [ ] libspi
- [ ] libtwi
- [ ] libpwm
- [ ] libadc
- [ ] libtimer

#### The project `shiftavr-api` includes the following libraries: 
- [ ] libmcp3008
- [ ] libstepper
- [ ] libjoystick
- [ ] libultrasonic
- [ ] libmq135
- [ ] libvectormath
- [ ] libnumberformat
